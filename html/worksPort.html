                <p><em>Currently</em>, I am working on a project called ERDATA which is web-based system software that helps helpers to view the children's photos with their information such as name, age, and residence, and allows users to select the photo of their preference to go to a profile page of the selected child and it will give the choices for donation(help).

                <p><em>I have developed</em> web application called "GOJJO" with my four friends. The topic of house rent is one of our society's most fundamental issues. <br> When people search for affordable accommodations in city areas physically, it is incredibly difficult to find it nowadays. The house owner, on the other hand, must also rent the property. House owners can sign up for the app and use it to post all of the details about the house they want to rent, such as its location (region, city, sub-city), price, number of rooms, and photographs. Someone looking for a home can go to the web app, look at the residences, and contact the house owner. <br> <a style="text-decoration-line: underline; color:blue" href="https://github.com/Adaaking/GOJJO-HOUSE-RENT">repository</a>

                <p>I have built the 3D model of the J. Kenndy memorial library, located at Addis Ababa university's main campus. The modeling process of objects is done using blender, Which is a free and open-source 3D creation suite and supports the entirety of the 3D pipelineâ€”modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing,  motion tracking, and even video editing and game creation.
